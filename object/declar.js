//object is a kind of datatype where we can store multiple variable.In array we can store variable according to index number.But in object we can store variable as our wish..We can declar object by 2 way.1. object literal....2.object constructor.hence literal is common way so most of the time we use this method to declar object.let's start......


 var obj={      //obj is object name.

x:10,    // here x,y,z is property name & 10,20,30 are the property value.if there is two or more properties we have to put comma between them.value can be anything like number,string etc.
y:20,

z:30


}
console.log(obj)  //call

console.log(obj.x)   //if i need specific property from many.
